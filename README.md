# URL Shortener

This was a live coding challenge for a recent job interview. Post-challenge, we discussed concurrency protection. I improved upon my original solution to add that concurrency protection - this is the `advanced` folder. The `simple` folder is what was developed during the interview.

Tests can be run with `python tests.py` from either the simple/advanced subdirectories.

## Notes

I must confess that I originally struggled with the concept a little bit as the only brief I got for the task were the comments at the top of the url_shortener file. However, once the required functionality had been more clearly scoped out, I was able to implement the solution fairly well (in my opinion).

Fun little project!
